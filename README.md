**Exploratory Analysis of the Titanic Dataset**

## Introduction
> The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.

> One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.

## Project summary
> In my project, I did data exploration and analysis in which My main focus was finding out the surviving rate of the people in the ship. I answered the following questions about the dataset:
- Which gender had a better chance of survival ?

- What was women and children chance of survival vs adult men (children age<18)

- What was the probability of survival for children, men and women?

- Which age group had a better chance of survival?

- Person travelling with others had more survival possibility?

## Project findings
- Female survial rate was 74.3%, and male survival rate was 18.9% - so female survival rate was about 4 times that of males. Hence, female and children were given preference in rescue operations, and must have been saved by other male passengers.

- 62.96 percent of 1st class passengers survived, whereas 3rd class passengers survival rate was 24.24% which is about one-third of the first class passengers. This is surprising that the 1st class passengers have high survival, that is they were given preference because of their social class.

- 50% of passengers travelling with family survived, whereas survival percentage was 30% for those travelling alone. Hence survival rate was high for passengers travelling with family, as compared to those travelling alone.

- Children had higer rate of survival as compared to adults

## Project limitations
### Limitations in the analysis
Above only visualization, proportions, and percentages have been used to come to conclusions. However improvements could be made in the analysis by using statistical tests.

### Limitations of the data
- The dataset itself has some limitations - it has data missing for certain features/properties of passengers, like age
- Also this data is only sample data from the population/full-data of titanic.

- Missing data and sample size could skew the results, for example becuase of missing ages

- Also we do not know if this sample was properly randomly selected
